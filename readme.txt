This SD card contains a pentest challenge,
it's the first time I've done anything like this
so I probably made it too easy.

The SD card is for the raspberry pi zero

Challenge 1: 
connect the Pi to Wi-Fi

Challenge 2: 
find a way to ssh into the Raspberry Pi

Challenge 2: 
launch the congratulations.py script
in the /home/pi directory

Since this is probably your first
introduction to Raspberry Pi OS
I'm happy to answer any questions and 
give you hints if you get stuck
